# Animated Waves
This is a web browser extension that replaces the new tab page with animated waves and gradient backgrounds.

It is currently available on:

- [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/animated-waves/jgohabjfpkldfcenkgbpddfbdnfjgnal)

Coming soon to Firefox.

### Currently this extension is going through a rewrite, and as such this repository will not have all of the features of v2.0.0

This extension takes some CSS and the wave SVG graphic from [this repository](https://github.com/DAGINATSUKO/www-rpcs3).
